# BookBinder

This is a web application designed and implemented using modern web technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, PHP (Symfony Framework), and JavaScript ES6 and beyond. The goal of the project is to create a healthy and thought-through code base that includes a wide set of features. The team will work collaboratively and follow an agile process, using a GitLab Issue Board and Git log as process documentation.

*The subject of the project is BookBinder, which is described in detail in the HCI course introduction. The team will put their own focus on the project and select a set of features they want to implement.*

## Minimal Requirements

- MySQL database with 5 or more tables
- Fully mapped ORM
- User login/authentication
- Test code coverage >65%
- Test data with >1000 database records
- Use of local/remote JSON API
- (Automatically) deployed on studev.groept.be server

## Team

- Scrum Master - *tbd*
- Database Maintainer - *tbd*
- Deployment, CI/CD Manager - *tbd*
- Test Engineer - *tbd*

## Evaluation

The project will be evaluated based on several factors, including the development process, issue board, Git log (commit messages, feature branches), testing (coverage, mocking), code base, and web app. The team's coding style should be consistent, and the code should be refactored and compliant with standards (W3C). 

During the exam period, there will be a live demo of the web app, followed by a Q&A session with all team members. Peer assessment will also be conducted.
