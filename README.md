# BookBinder

This is a web application designed and implemented using modern web technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, PHP (Symfony Framework), and JavaScript ES6. The goal of the project was to create a healthy and thought-through code base that includes a wide set of features. The team worked collaboratively and followed an agile process, using a GitLab Issue Board and Git log as process documentation.

## Project URL's & Website credentials
Here's the [Main login page](https://a22web31.studev.groept.be/). From there you can register a new account or login with an existing one. For a full experience we recommend using the following the registration process, but you can also use the following credentials to login with one of the existing accounts:
### Regular user A
- login : vini@gmail.com
- password : secret
### Regular user B
- login : tim@gmail.com
- password : secret

This way you can navigate through the website with two different accounts and see how the user-interaction related features work.

### User Authentication
The user authentication is handled by the Symfony Security bundle. The user can login with an existing account or register a new one. The registration process is also avaliable for Google Auth0. The user can login with their Google account or create a new account using their email address and a password.

When users register for the first time, they are redirected to a reading interests page. There, they can select their favorite genres and languages. The genres are used to recommend books to the user in the home page.

The login and registration forms have browser and server side validation. The user is notified if they enter invalid data.

### Home Page

The home page shows book recommendations and recent reviews from other users. The recommendations are based on the user's preferred genres or if they don't have any, default genres are used. The user can click on a book to view more information. For the reviews, the user can click on the book title to view the book information. Clicking on the username will take them to the author's profile.

### Search Bar
The search-bar contains two event listeners.

1. Submit event

The submit event is used for the search itself. It checks the contents of the input
and redirects the user to ```/book-search/{query}``` where the controller uses the google-books API to list a number
of books based on the query. Each book on the search-page has a href to its book-page

2. Keyup

We utilize our cached books table to provide autosuggestions as the user is typing in the searchbar.

### OpenAI API
Another feature on the website is an AI book recommendation system.
It utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo Large Language Model to recommend books based on a prompt.

A prompt could be "Something about magic and wizards", after pressing the generate button
Javascript does a fetch request on one of our endpoints that uses the OpenAI API to get a response.
This response is the title of the book it recommends. After some prompt engineering this is working fairly well.
After acquiring the book title it does another fetch request to an endpoint that uses the google-books API
and returns a google-books ID and a link to the books thumbnail.

The javascript then appends this title and thumbnail to the recommendation panel with a href on the thumbnail
that leads to the book-page.


### Book Page
Upon accessing the book-page first a request will be made to the database to check if we have
a cached version of the book based on the ID and display that. If there is no entry for it a google-books API request is made
to retrieve the information and is added to the cache table in the database.

On the page, a summary and general information on the book is shown. It also shows the book's rating and how many reviews it has received. The user can add the book to one of three reading lists: "Want to read", "Currently reading" or "Have read". These are mutally exclusive so only one can be selected at the same time. Added books are shown on the "My list" page. Next, the page shows the book's upcoming meetups that the user can join. After joining, the user can find the meetup in their meetup overview. The user can also host a new meetup, choosing library, date and time and maximium number of participants allowed. After filling in the form, the user becomes the host and other users can now request to join that meetup. The new meetup will also appear in their meetup overview. Lastly, the page shows the latest reviews on the book. The user can click on the username to check the profile of the author.

### Add review
On the book page, the user can add a review on the book or if the user already has one, edit their review. A review consists of a rating between 1 and 5 stars and a comment.


### Meetup Page 
The meetup page displays 3 rows for meetup information and actions. The first row displays the meetups that the user hosts or has joined. In the second row, the user can accept or reject requests from other users to join your meetups. Lastly, the third row shows upcoming meetups that the user can join.

### MyList Page
The "My list" page contains three rows: "Want to read", "Currently reading" or "Have read". It shows the books for which the user has selected a tag in their respective row. The user can click on a book to see it's book page, where the user can also change it's selected tag.

### Profile Page
The profile page shows the user's username, full name (if possible), language and genre preferences, a summary of the user's reading lists and their reviews. Clicking on a reading list takes the user to their "My list" page. Clicking on the book title of a review takes the user to the book page where they can edit it.

For reviews and meetups, if the user clicks on another user's username, it brings the user to their profile page. It contains the same information except no full name and books for the reading lists instead of a summary.

### Settings Page
The settings page contains a form with the current profile settings filled in by default. The fields are "Nickname", "Name", "Surname", "Languages" and "Genres". These can be changed and then confirmed by pressing the "submit" button. If the new nickname is already in use, the user is notified.

## Running the Website Locally from cmd prompt (Windows)

1. Install Scoop by following the instructions on the [Scoop website](https://scoop.sh/).

2. Once installed, use Scoop to install the Symfony CLI by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    scoop install symfony-cli
    ```

3. After installation, use the Symfony local server to run the website. The server can be installed by following the instructions on the [Symfony website](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/symfony_server.html).

4. After installation, run the following command in your terminal to start the server:
    ```
    symfony server:start
    ```

5. If you are using Docker, make sure to expose the port the web server runs the application on to access it.

## Running tests Locally from cmd prompt (Windows)
First, make sure you hava a test database set up. Use MySQL Installer to install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench.  
Then, create a new database called "bookbinder_test". Alternatively, you can repurpose the coubooks local server database that
we used in one of the Labs.

Second, create a .env.test.local file in the root of the project. Add the following code:  
```
# define your env variables for the test env here
KERNEL_CLASS='App\Kernel'
APP_SECRET='$ecretf0rt3st'
SYMFONY_DEPRECATIONS_HELPER=999999
PANTHER_APP_ENV=panther
PANTHER_ERROR_SCREENSHOT_DIR=./var/error-screenshots

###> doctrine/doctrine-bundle ###
# Format described at https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/configuration.html#connecting-using-a-url
# IMPORTANT: You MUST configure your server version, either here or in config/packages/doctrine.yaml

OPEN_AI_KEY='sk-<your key here>'
```
Replace the values in <> with your own values.

Then, make sure that all composer dependencies are installed by running the following command in your terminal:
```
composer update vendor/package --with-dependencies
composer install
```  
If you have no dependency issues, you can run the tests by running the following command in your terminal:
```
php bin/console make:migration 
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --env=test
php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:loadÂ --env=test
```
This will create the database tables and populate them with test data. 

If you get migration errors, try running the following command in your terminal:
```
php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --forceÂ --env=test
```

If you  get a "ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE" error, follow the instructions on this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44946270/er-not-supported-auth-mode-mysql-server/52726522#52726522r).

Finally, run the tests by running the following command in your terminal:
```
php bin/phpunit
```
